Open Share is an open-source application designed for secure password sharing. It provides a simple and secure way to share sensitive information with others while maintaining control over access and visibility.

## About

This app provides a quick and secure way to share passwords, similar to sending a self-destructing message. It's designed for simplicity, security, and peace of mind.

## Features

1. **Instant Encryption**: Passwords are immediately encrypted upon entry.
2. **Unique URL Generation**: A special URL containing the encrypted password and a unique secret key is created.
3. **Expiration Setting**: Users can set an expiration time for added security.
4. **No Storage Policy**: Passwords are never stored on our servers, existing only within the generated URL.
